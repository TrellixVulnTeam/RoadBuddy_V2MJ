## A problem we have personally experienced ...

Accidents due to drowsy drivers continue to increase yearly. Those are accounted for 72,000 in 2013, and 91,000 in 2017. It is more than **800 fatalities** each year! - NHTSA

**We know it is dangerous - but we still do it anyways.** Approximately 50% of US drivers admit to driving while being drowsy. 20% admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel at some point in the past year. Drowsy driving affects everyone, but particularly those driving alone between midnight and 6 a.m., or in the late afternoon.

## To tackle this issue, we have come up with ...

OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION: A buddy for everyone that will keep you alert during your trip without them nagging you about how bad of a driver you are!

ACTIVE PREVENTION: Timely check-ins to make sure you are all-right, and suggestions to take a break from driving.

DRIVER MONITORING: Using the heart rate variability signal to monitor the driver's condition.
